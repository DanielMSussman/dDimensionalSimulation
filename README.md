# dDimensionalSimulation

Aa repository that implements simulations in dimension d, where d is specified
at compilation time. Alter the dimension by setting the number in the root CMakeLists.txt

Many of the functions are lightly tested and lightly documented. A fork of this ws turned into open Qmin, but many of the MD-functions here have yet to be used in publication-quality research.
